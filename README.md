# curl-to-java

I really wanted something that could take a curl and turn into a spring Spring rest template. I then realized that I could also generate checks for telemetry, in order to make sure that systems are behaving as expected. This is the result!


## How to Use
Add your curls in resources/curls.txt and run Main.java

## Requirements
Java 9+
